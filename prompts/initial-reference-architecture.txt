I want to start a new project. 

It is for my Color It Daily website. 

Right now, I finetuned a diffusion model to generate coloring pages for kids. I generate a bunch in batch and they get featured daily one at a time.

Things have been evolving and I feel I don't need to finetune a diffusion model anymore (I am thinking of leveraging Nano Banana Pro). 

Therefore, I want to automate my daily generation flow. I want to rely on a custom multi-agent built with Google ADK. 

I need the following functionality. 

- First, need to define what will be the high level idea for the coloring page to be generated (description, and a series of tags describing the content). 
    This should consider coloring pages previously published to make sure new coloring pages are unique. 
    I would also like to consider the current date to influence the theme. 
    For example, during december we should generate holidays themed coloring page, etc. 
    I always themes that are  inclusive but I would like the generation to feel grounded throughout the year
- Second, with the description and the tafs we need to create a detailed text prompt (optimized for nano banana) to generate exactly the style of the image we want. 
    I will provide a couple of different style description that can be used and that should be adapted to the specific description. 
    Each style will correspond to a collection name and each day it should be randomly selected. 
    Very important that the style description is detailed enough to generate consistent art, it's also ok that the description be adapted to produce the desired effect 
- Third we now need to generate the image using Nano Banana Pro and the detailed text prompt a tool is then used to upscale (if possible) and optimize the image so that it can be printed on landscape paper 2550px x 3300 (I believe).
- Forth, once this content is generated we need to make sure it is high quality before publishing. If not we need to go back to step #3. 

Can you suggest a multi-agent flow with Google ADK. Also suggest a list of tools I will need. 

Ask clarifying questions if needed and let me know if I may have forgotten something to consider.
